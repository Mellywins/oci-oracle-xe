# Quick Start

Run a new database container (data is removed when the container is removed, but kept throughout container restarts):

```shell
docker run -d -p 1521:1521 -e ORACLE_PASSWORD=<your password> gvenzl/oracle-xe
```

Run a new persistent database container (data is kept throughout container lifecycles):

```shell
docker run -d -p 1521:1521 -e ORACLE_PASSWORD=<your password> -v oracle-volume:/opt/oracle/oradata gvenzl/oracle-xe
```

Run a new persistent **11g R2** database container (volume path differs in 11g R2):

```shell
docker run -d -p 1521:1521 -e ORACLE_PASSWORD=<your password> -v oracle-volume:/u01/app/oracle/oradata gvenzl/oracle-xe:11
```

Reset database `SYS` and `SYSTEM` passwords:

```shell
docker exec <container name|id> resetPassword <your password>
```

# How to use this image

## Subtle differences between versions

The 11gR2 (11.2.0.2) Oracle Database version stores the database data files under `/u01/app/oracle/oradata/XE`.  
**A volume for 11gR2 has to be pointed at `/u01/app/oracle/oradata`!**

## Environment variables

Environment variables allow you to customize your container. Note that these variables will only be considered during the database initialization (first container startup).

### `ORACLE_PASSWORD`
This variable is mandatory for the first container startup and specifies the password for the Oracle Database `SYS` and `SYSTEM` users.

### `ORACLE_RANDOM_PASSWORD`
This is an optional variable. Set this variable to a non-empty value, like `yes`, to generate a random initial password for the `SYS` and `SYSTEM` users. The generated password will be printed to stdout (`ORACLE PASSWORD FOR SYS AND SYSTEM: ...`).

### `ORACLE_DATABASE` (for 18c and onwards)
This is an optional variable. Set this variable to a non-empty string to create a new pluggable database with the name specified in this variable.  
**Note:** this variable is only supported for Oracle Database XE 18c and onwards; 11g does not support pluggable databases.  
**Note:** creating a new database will add to the initial container startup time. If you do not want that additional startup time, use the already existing `XEPDB1` database instead.

### `APP_USER`
This is an optional variable. Set this variable to a non-empty string to create a new database schema user with the name specified in this variable. The user will be created in the default `XEPDB1` pluggable database. If `ORACLE_DATABASE` has been specified, the user will also be created in that pluggable database. This variable requires `APP_USER_PASSWORD` or `APP_USER_PASSWORD_FILE` to be specified as well.

### `APP_USER_PASSWORD`
This is an optional variable. Set this variable to a non-empty string to define a password for the database schema user specified by `APP_USER`. This variable requires `APP_USER` to be specified as well.

## GitHub Actions
The images can be used as a [Service Container](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/about-service-containers) within a [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) workflow. Below is an example service definition for your GitHub Actions YAML file:

```yaml
    services:

      # Oracle service
      oracle:

        # Docker Hub image (feel free to change the tag "latest" to any other available one)
        image: gvenzl/oracle-xe:latest

        # Provide passwords and other environment variables to container
        env:
          ORACLE_RANDOM_PASSWORD: true
          APP_USER: my_user
          APP_USER_PASSWORD: my_password_which_I_really_should_change

        # Forward Oracle port
        ports:
          - 1521:1521

        # Provide healthcheck script options for startup

## Container secrets

As an alternative to passing sensitive information via environment variables, `_FILE` may be appended to some of the previously listed environment variables, causing the initialization script to load the values for those variables from files present in the container. In particular, this can be used to load passwords from Container/Docker secrets stored in `/run/secrets/<secret_name>` files. For example:

```shell
docker run --name some-oracle -e ORACLE_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/oracle-passwd -d gvenzl/oracle-xe
```

This mechanism is supported for:

* `APP_USER_PASSWORD`
* `ORACLE_PASSWORD`
* `ORACLE_DATABASE`

## Initialization scripts
If you would like to perform additional initialization of the database running in a container, you can add one or more `*.sql`, `*.sql.gz`, `*.sql.zip` or `*.sh` files under `/container-entrypoint-initdb.d` (creating the directory if necessary). After the database setup is completed, these files will be executed automatically in alphabetical order.

The `*.sql`, `*.sql.gz` and `*.sql.zip` files will be executed in Sql*Plus as the `SYS` user connected to the Oracle instance (`XE`). Compressed files will be uncompressed on the fly, allowing for e.g. bigger data loading scripts to save space.

Executable `*.sh` files will be run in a new shell process while non-executable `*.sh` files (files that do not have the Linux e`x`ecutable permission set) will be sourced into the current shell process. The main difference between these methods is that sourced shell scripts can influence the environment of the current process and should generally be avoided. However, sourcing scripts allows for execution of these scripts even if the executable flag is not set for the files containing them. This basically avoids the "why did my script not get executed" confusion.

***Note:*** scripts in `/container-entrypoint-initdb.d` are only run the first time the database is initialized; any pre-existing database will be left untouched on container startup.

***Note:*** you can also put files under the `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` directory. This is kept for backwards compatibility with other widely used container images but should generally be avoided. Do not put files under `/container-entrypoint-initdb.d` **and** `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` as this would cause the same files to be executed twice!

***Warning:*** if a command within the sourced `/container-entrypoint-initdb.d` scripts fails, it will cause the main entrypoint script to exit and stop the container. It also may leave the database in an incomplete initialized state. Make sure that shell scripts handle error situations gracefully and ideally do not source them!

***Warning:*** do not exit executable `/container-entrypoint-initdb.d` scripts with a non-zero value (using e.g. `exit 1;`) unless it is desired for a container to be stopped! A non-zero return value will tell the main entrypoint script that something has gone wrong and that the container should be stopped.

### Example

The following example installs the [countries, cities and currencies sample data set](https://github.com/gvenzl/sample-data/tree/master/countries-cities-currencies) under a new user `TEST` into the database:

```shell
[gvenzl@localhost init_scripts]$ pwd
/home/gvenzl/init_scripts

[gvenzl@localhost init_scripts]$ ls -al
total 12
drwxrwxr-x   2 gvenzl gvenzl   61 Mar  7 11:51 .
drwx------. 19 gvenzl gvenzl 4096 Mar  7 11:51 ..
-rw-rw-r--   1 gvenzl gvenzl  134 Mar  7 11:50 1_create_user.sql
-rwxrwxr-x   1 gvenzl gvenzl  164 Mar  7 11:51 2_create_data_model.sh

[gvenzl@localhost init_scripts]$ cat 1_create_user.sql
ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER=XEPDB1;

CREATE USER TEST IDENTIFIED BY test QUOTA UNLIMITED ON USERS;

GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO TEST;

[gvenzl@localhost init_scripts]$ cat 2_create_data_model.sh
curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gvenzl/sample-data/master/countries-cities-currencies/install.sql

sqlplus -s test/test@//localhost/XEPDB1 @install.sql

rm install.sql

```

As the execution happens in alphabetical order, numbering the files will guarantee the execution order. A new container started up with `/home/gvenzl/init_scripts` pointing to `/container-entrypoint-initdb.d` will then execute the files above:

```shell
podman run --name test \
>          -p 1521:1521 \
>          -e ORACLE_RANDOM_PASSWORD="y" \
>          -v /home/gvenzl/init_scripts:/container-entrypoint-initdb.d \
>      gvenzl/oracle-xe:18.4.0-full

## Startup scripts

If you would like to perform additional action after the database running in a container has been started, you can add one or more `*.sql`, `*.sql.gz`, `*.sql.zip` or `*.sh` files under `/container-entrypoint-startdb.d` (creating the directory if necessary). After the database is up and ready for requests, these files will be executed automatically in alphabetical order.

The execution order and implications are the same as with the [Initialization scripts](#initialization-scripts) described above.

***Note:*** you can also put files under the `/docker-entrypoint-startdb.d` directory. This is kept for backwards compatibility with other widely used container images but should generally be avoided. Do not put files under `/container-entrypoint-startdb.d` **and** `/docker-entrypoint-startdb.d` as this would cause the same files to be executed twice!

***Note:*** if the database inside the container is initialized (started for the first time), startup scripts are executed after the setup scripts.

***Warning:*** files placed in `/container-entrypoint-startdb.d` are always executed after the database in a container is started, including pre-created databases. Use this mechanism only if you wish to perform a certain task always after the database has been (re)started by the container.
